[Verse 1]
Walking through the city lights
Chasing dreams on endless nights
Every step a story told
Heart of fire, spirit bold

[Chorus]
We rise, we fall, we learn to fly
Reaching for the endless sky
Through the storms and through the rain
We'll find our way back home again

[Verse 2]
Shadows fade with morning sun
New beginnings have begun
Every moment, every breath
Living life with no regrets

[Chorus]
We rise, we fall, we learn to fly
Reaching for the endless sky
Through the storms and through the rain
We'll find our way back home again

[Bridge]
In the silence, hear the call
Stand together, never fall
Hand in hand, we'll make it through
This journey's meant for me and you

[Outro]
We'll find our way back home
We'll find our way back home
